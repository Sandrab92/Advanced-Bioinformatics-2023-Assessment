#Task 3.1. Using the sum() function and : operator, write an expression in the code snippet to evaluate the sum of all integers between 5 and 55.
#'5:55' - creates the sequence of all integers from 5 - 55
#'sum()'- calculates the sum of all integers in the above sequence
#'result' - is the variable that stored the result of the sum
#'print(result)' prints the result to the console.
result <- sum(5:55)
print(result)
```

#Task 3.2. Write a function called sumfun with one input parameter, called n, that calculates the sum of all integers between 5 and n. Use the function to do the calculation for n = 10, n = 20, and n = 100 and present the results
#'sumfun' - takes input parameter 'n' and calculates the sum of all integers between 5 and 'n'

#Task 3.7. Again, using the cars dataset, now use linear regression (lm) to estimate the average reaction time for the driver to start breaking (in seconds). To simplify matters you may assume that once breaking commences, breaking distance is proportional to the square of the speed. Explain the steps in your analysis. Do you get reasonable results? Finally, use ggplot to plot the data points and the fitted relationship. 

# Loading ggplot library
library(ggplot2)

# Loading the cars dataset

# Data Transformation: Calculate breaking distance using the relationship that breaking distance is proportional to the square of speed
cars$breaking_distance <- cars$dist - (cars$speed^2)

# Analysis of Results: Get the coefficients of the model
coefficients <- coef(model)

# Extracting the coefficient for speed^2, which represents the average reaction time
average_reaction_time <- coefficients["speed^2"]

# Printing the estimated average reaction time
